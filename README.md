## Neptune Interview

This interview consists of four verbal questions and two coding questions. You will have an hour to answer all questions. We suggest spending 10 minutes on the verbal questions, 15 minutes on the rust question and 35 minutes on the Solana question.

While working through the coding questions **please be sure to verbalize your thought process** while working on a solution. We are as interested in your ability to communicate your thoughts as we are in your programming competancy. 

To begin, please clone this repo to your local machine and work on your solution there. Once you are finished, push your solution to **a new remote repo** and give access to `0xtempest` and `rusted-ruby` on Github. Note that this final push must happen within the timeframe of the technical intervew, so manage time accordingly. 

Good Luck!
