## Rust Question
We have the beginnings of a program that will keep track of the students at a school named Rust University. This code contains a function that creates a `School` object that contains a vector of `Student` objects. The `School` object already stores some members of the Neptune team as students.

Your assignment is to write code that will add yourself to the existing `School` object. When we call `println!` on the `School` object, the `Student` object with an `id` of `2` should have its `name` field populated with your name.
